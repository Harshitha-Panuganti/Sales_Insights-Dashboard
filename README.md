# Sales_Insights-Dashboard

Atliq Hardware, a leading supplier of computer hardware and peripherals, struggled to track sales performance across its regional offices in a rapidly evolving market. Scattered sales data stored in numerous Excel files made it challenging to gain a clear, actionable understanding of their business performance.

To solve this, I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard that:

Centralized sales data from the last 4 years.
Provided real-time insights into revenue trends, sales performance by region and market, top customers/products by revenue, and return product analysis.
Highlighted underperforming regions and markets for immediate attention.

ðŸ’¡ Impact:

Streamlined reporting processes, saving time and effort for stakeholders.
Enabled data-driven decisions to target areas with growth potential.
Equipped decision-makers with actionable insights that could drive a 7% revenue increase in the next quarter.
